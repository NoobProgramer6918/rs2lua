# Rulest thou must follow
1. Idk like dont inject backdoors or stuff
2. Make this as cross platform as possible
  if some thing is win only or linus os only then DO NOT USE THAT.
3. Use 4 spaces or tabs
  Yea i know 2 spaces is wayy better but my text editor for some reason indents 4 spaces instead of 2 for rust
